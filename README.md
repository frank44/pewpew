#Andy's Goals:

- Have the background change also as the screen scrolls.
- Factoids upon death
- Pause screen and menus

# Eve's Current Actions

Move Left  = A or Left arrow
Move Right = D or Right arrow
Jump       = W or Space
Dash       = S or Down arrow

 

# Coming up: 
  Crawling
  Dashing needs to change the hitbox


# Standing bugs
  Note that this sprite will change, so don’t touch this bug yet. 
  Dying while dashing does not lead to a dying animation. (Minor/Frequent)
  You die if you hit the side of the screen with too much velocity. (Medium/Rare)


# Recent Bug Fixes
  Dying animation is animating incorrectly. (Minor/Frequent)
  Jumping under an obstacle leaves you suspended for an instant. (Minor/Frequent)
