# Frank's Log:
- Haven't done anything yet...
- Why can't I seem to be cool?
- I hope someone thinks I'm cool...
- Wait, how does git work again?

# Frank's Goals:
- Be more like Oscar

# Andy's Log:

- Completed side scrolling both vertically and horizontally for any screen size and level size (2-14-12)

# Andy's Goals:

- Have the background change also as the screen scrolls.
- Factoids upon death
- Pause screen and menus
