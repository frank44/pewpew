Air
* In 2007, global emissions of carbon dioxide rose, reaching 30 billion metric tons. 
* In 2008, carbon dioxide emissions declined, potentially due to the global financial crisis.
* The Montreal Protocol is an international treaty to phase out ozone depleting substances. 
* While developing countries lack resources, they are willing to take part in green initiatives when given assistance. 
* By saving the ozone, we protect the planet from ultraviolet radiation that can cause skin cancer and eye cataracts.
* Air pollution is the release of chemicals and particulates into the atmosphere. 
* Air pollution is linked to the death of 1.5 million people each year with illnesses such as pneumonia, asthma, and lung and heart disease.  
* Some air pollution is caused by natural sources such as methane produced by digestion of animals and smoke from wildfires. 
* Children who are exposed to high levels of air pollutants are more likely to develop asthma, pneumonia, and lower respiratory infections. 
Miscellaneous
* The loss of biodiversity continues even as other environmental concerns are being addressed. 
* Nearly 17,000 species of plants and animals are threatened with extinction. 
* Extinction of species can occur due to high rates of resource consumption, habitat loss, invasive species, pollution, and climate change. 
* Biodiversity allows the natural ecosystems to stay in balance. 
* Only 12% of the planet’s land area and 1% of the sea area are under protection to save biodiversity. 
* In developing regions, rural communities still lack safe drinking water in every household. 
* Globally, 8 out of 10 people who are still without access to improved drinking water sources live in rural areas. 
* A rapid, reliable, and cost effective method to monitor local water quality is needed globally. 
* In developing regions, over half of the population is without sanitation. 
Radioactive
* Radioactive contamination occurs when radioactive substances are present in undesirable locations such as the soil and water. 
* Low levels of radioactive contamination pose little risk and are usually allowed to naturally decay. 
* High levels of radioactive contamination can cause biological effects to nearby living sources. 
* Radioactive waste are usually byproducts of nuclear power generation or nuclear applications in medicine and research.
* Radioactivity diminishes over time and must be stored until no longer a hazard. 
* One way to prevent radioactive waste is to phase out nuclear power by replacing with renewable energy. 
* Nuclear waste requires treatment and management to isolate it from interacting with the earth.
