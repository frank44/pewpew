Tuberculosis
* Tuberculosis is an infectious disease transmitted through a cough or sneeze into the air.
* A person with untreated and active tuberculosis can infect 10-15 other people per year. 
* The main cause of tuberculosis is a small bacterium, which is not effected by many antibiotics. 
* Tuberculosis most often attacks the lungs and has classic symptoms such as a chronic cough, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. 
* Tuberculosis is usually a latent disease which does not show any symptoms. 
* Of those infected with tuberculosis, only about 5-10% develop the active disease. This increases to 30% when co-infected with HIV. 
* When tuberculosis is active and left untreated, it may kill more than 50% of those infected. 
* Treatment of tuberculosis is difficult and requires a long course of multiple antibiotics. 
* Tuberculosis can usually be prevented with a vaccination. 
* In 2010, there were 8.8 million new cases of tuberculosis and 1.45 million deaths, with most in developing countries. 
* As much as 80% of the population in many Asian and African countries test positive for tuberculosis, while only 5-10% of the U.S. population tests positive. 
Malaria
* Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease caused by parasites. 
* Malaria transmission can be reduced by preventing mosquito bites, such as with mosquito nets and insect repellents. 
* No vaccine offering a high level of protection currently exists for malaria. 
* An estimated 655,000 people died from malaria in 2010. 
* Since many cases of malaria occur where hospitals are not accessible, many cases are undocumented and untreated. 
* 90% of malaria-related deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa, 60% of which are children 5 years or younger. 
* There are different types of malaria, some more severe than others. 
* The only way to completely eliminate malaria would be to eliminate the parasite from the entire world. 
* Education in recognizing the symptoms of malarias has reduced the number of cases in some areas by as much as 20%. 
* By covering areas of still water such as water tanks, mosquito breeding grounds are reduced, with fewer malaria cases as a result. 
HIV/AIDS
* Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can cause acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). 
* AIDS causes a failure of the immune system and allows infections and cancers to thrive. 
* HIV infection occurs with the transmission of bodily fluids. 
* HIV infects about 0.6 % of the world's population.
* Treatment can reduce mortality and morbidity of the HIV infection. 
* There are two types of HIV: HIV 1 is more infectious while HIV-2 is less infectious. 
* Most people infected with HIV-1 and untreated will eventually develop AIDS, usually with 10 years. 
* Without therapy and treatment, someone with AIDS usually dies within a year. 
* Currently, there is no publicly available vaccine or cure for HIV or AIDS.
* 67% of those currently living with HIV live in sub-Saharan Africa. 15% live in Asia. 
* Education is currently the best way to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS.
